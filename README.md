# Bank Account System with TDD  


## Summary  
This project implements a **bank account management system** using the **Mockist Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach**. The goal was to create an **account service** that allows users to:  

âœ… **Deposit money**  
âœ… **Withdraw money**  
âœ… **Print transaction history**  

To enhance functionality, we introduced:  
âœ” **Transaction filtering** to display only deposits or withdrawals.  
âœ” **Exporting transactions to a CSV file** for record-keeping.  

This solution follows **TDD principles**, ensuring each feature was designed and implemented only after writing tests, leading to a **robust, maintainable, and testable system**.

## Development Steps  

### ðŸŸ¢ `AccountService.java` (Main Business Logic)  
Manages deposits, withdrawals, and balance updates.  

**Key responsibilities:**  
âœ” Stores transactions in `TransactionRepository`.  
âœ” Calls `StatementPrinter` to display transactions.  
âœ” Ensures transactions follow correct business rules.  

---

### ðŸŸ¢ `Transaction.java` (Transaction Model)  
Represents a single financial transaction.  

**Attributes:**  
âœ” `date` â†’ Transaction date.  
âœ” `amount` â†’ Transaction amount (positive for deposits, negative for withdrawals).  
âœ” `type` â†’ `DEPOSIT` or `WITHDRAWAL`.  

This class helps structure data and ensures transactions are easily manageable.  

---

### ðŸŸ¢ `TransactionRepository.java` (Data Storage)  
Stores transactions in memory.  

**Responsibilities:**  
âœ” Adds new transactions.  
âœ” Retrieves all past transactions.  

This allows the `AccountService` to **retrieve and process** account history efficiently.  

---

### ðŸŸ¢ `StatementPrinter.java` (Displaying Transactions)  
Formats and displays transactions in a user-friendly way.  

**Responsibilities:**  
âœ” Prints transactions in a **formatted table**.  
âœ” Computes and displays the **balance dynamically**.  

This ensures users have a clear **visual representation** of their account history.  

---

### ðŸŸ¢ `AccountServiceTest.java` (Unit Testing with Mockito)  
Contains **test cases** to validate the system using **Mockito**.  

âœ” Ensures **deposits and withdrawals are recorded** correctly.  
âœ” Verifies that the **printer and repository methods are called correctly**.  
âœ” Uses **mocking** to isolate components, improving test accuracy.  

By using **TDD**, all tests were written before implementation, ensuring a fully testable system.  

---

## Additional Features  

### Filtered Transactions (Deposits Only)  
Implemented a **filtering system** to display **only deposit transactions**.  

âœ” Improves **readability** when reviewing account history.  
âœ” Allows users to **analyze deposits separately**, aiding financial tracking.  

### Export Transactions to CSV  
Implemented **CSV exporting** to allow users to **save their transaction history**.  

âœ” Helps in **record-keeping** for financial audits.  
âœ” Ensures users can access **offline transaction logs**.  

By computing the **balance dynamically**, we ensure that CSV files are always accurate and up to date.

**This project not only enhances my expertise in Java development but also showcases the power of TDD in creating well-tested and maintainable software solutions.**
